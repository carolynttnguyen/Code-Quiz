  As a Coding Bootcamp studet, I understand how challenging it can get. You going to always want to do a sanity check, and make sure you know the material inside an out. With the intentions to  help any students get a little comprehensive check, I created a Code Quiz on Javascript fundamentals. I used Application Programming interfaces, composed of dynamically updated HTML, CSS, and powered by Javascript to build a timed quiz with multiple choice. As a web developer, you will most likely be asked to complete coding assessments with interactive challenges, on your journey. Taking the quiz would be a good way for you to grasp where you might be in theis learning process.</p>

  In my source code you will find, notes through each file to help others get a grasp of what the code is meant for, along with a clean and polished user interface. I made the page responsive as well, therefore leaving it more accesible. For my webpage design, I wanted to give it a little bit of a vibrant touches, so I linked Bootstrap to help me with the layout. In order to get the quiz generated, I create a series of functions via Javascript to get a dynamic interface.

  When you access the website, you will find that you're given instruction/rules for the Code Quiz. When you are ready to start, you can just click the start button, and begin.

  Some criterias that I considered -
```
  On click of the start button , a timer starts and a question is presented to you
  Once one question is answered, another question is presented going up to 8 questions
  If user answers question incorrectly, there will be a time penalty of -15 seconds
  When all questions have been answered or the timer is over, the game is over
  Once the game is over, you are showned your score and asked to submit your intials for a scoreboard.
```

## Installation
For the whole source code, you will want to link, a HTML, CSS, and JS file together. JS can be linked in the body of your HTMl.
For my code editor, I use [visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which can be installed from their website. A quick tip- have you HTMl opened in the browers, so you can refresh any time to see if any changes have been made, or if the functions are working properly. In additon, if you would like a more complex or decorative layout I reccomend using Bootstrap to aid with the process. It will save you a lot of time.
